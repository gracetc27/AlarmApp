# AlarmApp
This project allows users to create Alarms that go off at specific times. They have the choice of two different alarm editing views. They can choose to enable the alarm,
set a name and a description which will then be shown in the notification. The user can also set a sound, activity symbol and whether or not it repeats.
I have changed the logic and some design features in this app quite a lot from the original tutorial from the Deep Dive iOS 18 & SwiftUI 6: 80-Hour Project-Based Course.
